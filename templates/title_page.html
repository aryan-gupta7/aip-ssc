            <p>The Kingdom of Sikkim was founded by the Namgyal dynasty in the 17th century. It was ruled by Buddhist
                priest-kings known as the Chogyal. In 1642, Chogyal Phuntsog Namgyal was crowned as Sikkim's first ruler
                in Yuksom. It became a princely state of British India in 1890. Following Indian independence, Sikkim
                continued its territory status with the Union of India after 1947, and the Republic of India after 1950.
                In 1975, after the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok, Sikkim agreed for joining India as its
                22nd state.</p>
